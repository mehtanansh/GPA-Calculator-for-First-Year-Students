## GPA-Calculator-for-First-Year-Students
This project was built by me as First Year Project in my "Programming in C" course

## Problem Definition:
This program accepts the option (CGPI or SGPI or YPI) the user wants to calculate and accepts the respective input and gives the calculated output. Appropriate Results are shown even if there is a KT while calculating SGPI. It also displays the Criteria for allotting the Grade Pointers. 

## Input Specifications:

* Which all basic details to be entered?
* Which all marks to be entered?
* Who will enter the marks? 
* What will be the data type of the input?
* What will happen if other input of same data type is entered? 
* Will there be any provision to redo the same process by specifying a proper input? 

## Output Specifications:
* What will be the data type of output?
* What it will display if marks are below passing marks? 
* What it will display after calculation?
* Will it display the basic details?
* Will the output screen be cleared before displaying? 
* Will it continue taking input and calculate even if one subject marks is less than passing marks? 
* Will it show result as Pass or Fail?

## Special Specifications:
*	What will the program show if wrong Semester is entered?
*	What will the output be if wrong Group is entered? 
*	What if the user wants to do some other calculations? Will he have to run the code again?
*	What will the output be if wrong option is selected??
